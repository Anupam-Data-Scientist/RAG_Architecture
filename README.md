# 🤖 RAG Chatbot – Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assistant

A smart Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that combines the power of **semantic search** with **generative AI** to answer user queries more accurately. It retrieves relevant context from a custom dataset and passes it to a language model to generate grounded, informative responses.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search** using FAISS and Sentence Transformers
- 🧠 **Context-aware Response Generation** with Gemini/OpenAI
- 📄 Works with custom document data (e.g., NCERT PDFs, knowledge base)
- 🌗 Optional Dark Mode toggle in UI
- ⚡ Built with an interactive and responsive UI using Streamlit

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User enters a query**
2. The system performs **vector search** on the embedded document corpus
3. Top-k relevant chunks are retrieved as **context**
4. This context is passed along with the user query to a **Generative AI model**
5. The model returns a **grounded, accurate response**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Streamlit** – UI framework
- **FAISS** – Vector database for similarity search
- **Sentence Transformers** – Text embeddings
- **Google Gemini / OpenAI GPT / Mistral** – LLM backend
- **Custom Dataset** – e.g., NCERT Class X Science

🧠 Example Use Case
Query: “What is the function of the stomata in plants?”
RAG Chatbot Response:
“Stomata are tiny openings on the surface of leaves that allow the exchange of gases. They enable the plant to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen during photosynthesis.”

✅ To-Do / Future Enhancements
✨ Multi-document and multi-subject support

📊 Log and analyze user queries with timestamps

🔐 Add user authentication

🧩 Plugin-like modular architecture for datasets and LLMs

### ✅ Action Items for You:
- Replace `your-username` in the clone URL.
- If you're using **Gemini**, **OpenAI**, or another model, let me know — I can customize the README for API usage, key setup, or `.env` configuration.
- If you want a **logo**, **demo video**, or **GitHub stats badges**, I can add that too!

Would you like a second README version with deployment (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, or Docker)
